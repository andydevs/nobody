I made a mistake I should've never done 
this... I should've never left... These 
children... these souls... how many souls 
have we harvested...  sentenced the innocent 
to a fate worse than death... To this place. 
If you can call it a place... Don't make the 
same mistakes I did. Don't go down this path.
